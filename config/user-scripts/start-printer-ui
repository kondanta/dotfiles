# Note(taylan): So, `systemd-resolved(sd-resolved)`'s mDNS does not implement dns-sd and because of that
# CUPS does not work with sd-resolved. It requires avahi-deamon to be running to auto detect
# local printers. As of right now, I use mDNS with sd-resolved. The following code should:
# - edit /etc/systemd/resolved.conf -> disable mDNS
# - systemctl restart systemd-resolved
# - systemctl start avahi-daemon
# And revert those changes when it is done. 

if [ $(systemctl is-active cups) = "active" ]; then
    echo "CUPS service is running"
    system-config-printer
    sudo systemctl stop cups
else
    sudo systemctl start cups
    sleep 2
    system-config-printer
    sudo systemctl stop cups
fi
